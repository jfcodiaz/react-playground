# React Notes
## Create a new project

There are two tools that help us create a new React project: create-react-app (legacy, not officially deprecated but no longer recommended, preconfigured with Webpack) and Vite (currently the preferred choice due to better performance and modern tooling).

### Create with create-react-app (CRA)

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
```

### Create a new proyect with vite

```sh
npm create vite@latest my-react-app --template react
```
